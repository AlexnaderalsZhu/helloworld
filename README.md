# helloworld
my first repository just have a try:)
and then I tried to use the function of issue
I lived in China and I have seen the simailar function like this:
as far as I am concerned, this 'issue' is a kind of thing like Q&A and you can bring about a question and then 
you can wait others to answer this question for you or you can work out it by yourself and you can write down the 
comment which can help you know how you think about the question and can offer you a chance to discuss with other person to
have your work done faster and more accurate.
and I am going to use the branch and see how it work and what I can get form it?
